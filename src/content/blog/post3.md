When you love someone, you have to be brave.

Brave enough to tell them you love them.

Or brave enough to watch them love someone else.

Brave enough to get your heart broken.

Brave enough to spend your nights awake.

Brave enough to mend those little broken pieces.

Brave enough to count all the creases.

The creases of your broken heart are the days you will spend apart.

Brave enough to hold them.

Or brave enough to let them go.

But who in this world is truly brave?

For we humans are timid creatures, always living in our little caves.

So neither are we brave enough to tell them.

Nor are we brave enough to watch them—

watch them love someone else.

And the irony is this:

no one knows they are loved.

Because someone out there

is just not brave enough.
