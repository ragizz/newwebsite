The love that I know doesn’t knock on the door— 
it arrives quietly like a breath,
slipping in sideways— 
sometimes it’s just a shift in posture 
to make you feel comfortable,
a shoulder angled to shield you from the wind.
Sometimes, it’s the way someone waits,
without needing to be asked.

It speaks in half-smiles and packed lunches,
in “Call me when you’re home safe,”
in the hush between two people
who’ve learned that silence can be enough 
The kind of love that the children do—
without thinking too much.
They hand it over with jam-sticky fingers
and wide-open hearts,
trusting you’ll catch them—
because they don’t yet know
some hands let go.

Parent love is of a different kind—
wild, unreasonable, and bottomless.
It wakes up every three hours.
It goes without, so you don’t.
Even empty,
it saves the last warmth for you.
It’s a kind of holy madness.

A father giving away his only warm coat.
A mother scraping half her dinner
into her child’s bowl
when no one is looking—
love that gives
without asking back.

Then comes the love of the old—
quieter, slower.
They love by showing up,
even when the joints ache,
even when names
are harder to hold than spoons.

They fold blankets just the way they used to,
tell the same stories twice—
and somehow,
it matters more the second time.

And love is in the small, searing moments:
hands held in grief,
a kiss to the forehead that says “I’m still here,”
the quiet pride in a parent’s eyes
when their child doesn’t notice
they’re watching.

The thing about the love that I know is—
it doesn’t always stay.
But it leaves fingerprints:
on cups you still reach for,
on the air of old rooms,
on the person you became
because it was once there.

And somehow, still—
worth it.
