    desc="Chyasilin Mandap, meaning “eight corners,” is a two-storied wooden pavilion in Bhaktapur Durbar Square, originally built in the 17th century during the Malla Kingdom. It was constructed by King Bhupendra Malla as a protective barrier between the 55-window palace and the nearby Pakapur Pashupatinath Temple, believed to emit a powerful force. The pavilion’s unique octagonal design reflects this purpose. Over time, it served various roles, including a tax office during the Rana era. The 1934 earthquake destroyed it, but it was reconstructed—likely in the 1990s—and remarkably survived the 2015 earthquake without damage. Today, it stands as a testament to Bhaktapur’s rich heritage and architectural beauty."
